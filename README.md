# Graph VectorIndex Rag 

My primary contribution involved designing and implementing a graph- based vector index RAG  system leveraging LangChain and Neo4j for efficient retrieval and context management. The system was evaluated using Vectara alongside performance and relevance metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, Answer Relevance, F1-score, and Precision. Additionally, I contributed to building an agentic framework using LangGraph, integrating it with the RAG pipeline for autonomous and context-aware query handling. I am also familiar with evaluation and benchmarking tools such as TruLens.
